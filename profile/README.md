## Hi there 👋

The ocsf-docs repository is intended to be the location where relevant proposals, documentation or other descriptive information for the schema are stored. Documents such as OCSF Events.pdf or OCSF Objects.pdf are point in time snapshots of current work before public release. Over time, documents will be organized based on version of schema.

The governance repo holds the governance material.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
