## Introduction to OCSF

Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework is an open-source project, delivering an extensible framework for developing schemas, along with a vendor-agnostic core security schema.  Vendors and other data producers can adopt and extend the schema for their specific domains. Data engineers can map differing schemas to help security teams simplify data ingestion and normalization, so that data scientists and analysts can work with a common language for threat detection and investigation. While the framework itself is not tied to the cybersecurity domain the core schema and dictionary is focused on security events.  The goal is to provide an open standard, adopted in any environment, application, or solution, while complementing existing security standards and processes.

The framework is made up of a set of data types, an attribute dictionary, and the taxonomy. A schema browser for the cybersecurity schema can be found at [OCSF Schema](http://schema.ocsf.io).

OCSF is agnostic to storage format, data collection and ETL processes.  The core schema for cybersecurity events is intended to be agnostic to implementations.  The schema framework definition files and the resulting schema are written as JSON.
For an overview of the taxonomy concepts and the schema, you may find it instructive to read the white paper in the ocsf-docs repository.
